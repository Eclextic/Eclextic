### You have reached my profile!
First of all **thank you** for checking me out! Nice having you here!

I'm a curious student starting my journey in the development enviroment!\
A couple years ago I started game development (Unity) and am developing my first simple title: **No Dice Dots**. Inspired by Helltaker!\
<sup>Currently it is on hold (as I'm not old enough to launch a paid game).<sup>

That's why I'm working on **Aurora**, a Linux/Unix theme/configuration manager designed to make it trivial to create new themes, add different environments, add other users, all without duplicating files/images. It achieves this by examining similar files and generating the diffs. It's backend being Git. (Not an OSS, yet!)

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

IMO no one is truly smart, as to be smart, means to be knowing the bounds of knowledge! Which is why I will always be foolish!
